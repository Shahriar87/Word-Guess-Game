## Project Brief
A Hangman game with the theme of 90's Heavy Metal Bands

## Project Walkthrough
* On press of any key Computer chooses a random Band name from the provided array of Heavy Metal Band names
* The Band name is then displayed with 'dashes' for each of the letters
* Player has 9 chances to select right letter from the randomly selected band
* If any letter matches with the computer selected Band name, they are displayed by replacing the dashes
* If a letter key pressed player does not matches the letter from the Band names, it decreases one of the 9 chances and added a component of the Hangman image
* If all chances are missed, player loses and the game restarts automatically with another band name being randomly chosen
* If player guesses all the letter of the Band name before running out of 9 chances, player wins and a song of that Band is played on the back. The game also restarts with another band name being randomly chosen
